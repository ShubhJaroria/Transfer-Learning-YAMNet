# Transfer-Learning-YAMNet
Comparison of transfer-learning based methods using a pre-trained YAMNet model finetuned on ESC-50 and ESC-10 datasets.

Run the Colab notebook: models can be edited in the run_tests() function and trained to produce results, which are later used to make graphs and observations.
